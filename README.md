# Breeze
A Nintendo Switch game cheating tool.

This will start as a rewrite of the features I put into EdiZon SE. As I added features to EdiZon SE the code has become increasing hard to maintain and the UI is probably confusing for many users.

I have three objectives: 

1. To improve the UI so more users are able to enjoy the features. 
2. To make the code easier to built on.
3. Apply what I have learn in developing SE tools to build a better foundation for further development. 

# Features 
1. Manage cheat codes for atmosphere cheat VM. Toggling code on/off, easy adding/removing of conditional key, loading cheats from cheat database, picking cheats from multiple cheat file, editing cheats in app.
2. Search memory, edit memory, freeze memory, search for pointer chain to locate dynamic memory location. Creat memory and pointer chain bookmark. Generate cheat code from bookmark. Generate bookmark from cheat code.
3. Auto update of app and database. 
4. Consistant and easy to use UI.

#How to install

# Acknowledgement
The UI framework is derived from daybreak.
